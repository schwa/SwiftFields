# SwiftFields

SwiftFields is a collection of SwiftUI widgets for editing data. It was originally created with the aim of providing widgets for editing values in a 3D editor such as angles, vectors, matrixes, quaternions, etc.

This library is in early development.

Current widgets:

- `AngleEditor`: A widget for editing angles.
- `ClosedRangedSlider`: A slider for editing a ClosedRange of Doubles.
- `PathSlider': Like SwiftUI`s `Slider` but you can slide the thumb along any arbitrary path.
- `YASlider`: Like SwiftUI's `Slider` but with more functionality including vertical orientation, ~~custom thumb, and custom track~~.
